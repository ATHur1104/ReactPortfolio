        <h3> Bio </h3>
        <li>
          As a graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, I have cultivated a profound capacity for critical and logical thinking. I have a deep thirst for knowledge in attempt to understand the world around me. I am a self-motivated individual who is always looking to improve myself and my skills. In my free time I enjoy learning something new, playing video games and model kit building. I have played video games at a competitive level as well as worked for QA for a AAA game company. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Northwestern University.
